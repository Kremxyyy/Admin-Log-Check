Echo – The Ultimate Admin Tool for Gaming Servers

Echo is the must-have MultiTool for gaming admins, especially for FiveM, Garry’s Mod, and other multiplayer communities. Designed to give admins full control, Echo allows you to scan PCs for rule-breaking modifications, retrieve deleted files, and detect hidden cheats or exploits with ease.

With the BAM USB App, Echo goes even further. This feature tracks recently used applications from USB drives, ensuring that no one can run external mod menus or hacks and then delete them without a trace. If a player tries to hide their activity, BAM USB keeps the evidence in check.

Whether you're managing a FiveM RP server, an Arma community, or any other multiplayer environment, Echo ensures fair play and gives admins the upper hand against cheaters and rule-breakers. Stay ahead, stay in control!
